## Spring MVC Film C.R.U.D. Group Project


## Program Overview

The program itself is connected to a large database that consists of 1000 films.  The
database also consists of each films various details along with the actors who played in
each film.

Once the program is run, the user will be prompted with a main menu allowing them to 
search for a film by id, by keyword, or to exit the program.

If the user should choose to search for a film by id, the user will then be prompted to 
enter a film id. Once entered the user will be shown limited details regarding that film. 
A sub-menu will then populate the screen asking the user if they would like to get more 
details about that film or to return to the main menu.

If the user chooses to see more details, they will be shown a much more extensive list of
the film details. If they choose to return to the main menu, the main menu screen will 
populate for the user. 

If the search by keyword option is chosen, the user will be asked to enter their 
'keyword'. Once the keyword is entered the program will search for a title or a 
description of a movie that contains the contents of the keyword. Each and every result
will be shown to the user spaced in a way to be easily read by the user. 

If a user chooses a film ID or a keyword that does not exist in the database, they will 
be told that 0 results were returned and they may proceed as they would like from there.

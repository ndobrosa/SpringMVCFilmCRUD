## Spring MVC Film C.R.U.D. Group Project


## Program Overview

This program is connected to a large database that consists of 1000 films.  The
database also consists of various details about each film including title, description, release year, rating, etc. 

Once the program is run, the user is displayed with a main menu on a web page using a local server. The main menu includes the options to look up a film by an ID, look up a film by keyword, or to add a film into the database. In addition, the user has the options to edit or delete each film once it has been found by the database. 

If the user should choose to search for a film by id, the user will be shown a list of details regarding that film.  Under these details, they will be given the option to edit or delete that film. 

If the user chooses to edit that film, they will be shown all of the details about that film. Under the details, they will be provided with a couple of text boxes and drop down menu's allowing the user to change each of the details. Once the user submits their edits, that films details will be changed in the database.

If the user searches for a films using a keyword, each of the films that contains that keyword will be displayed. The user has the option of editing or deleting each of the films. 

If a user chooses to add a film, the user must enter each of the fields displayed as they are required by the database. Once the film has been added by the user, the film will be added into the database and can be searched for in the search by ID option.

## Lessons Learned

My group and I can all collectively agree that communication was the most important aspect of this project. In addition, we learned the importance of pair programming. We were able to see issues with much more ease with three sets of eyes on the code.
